    "We will consider two groups before and after a policy change, with the __treatment group__ being affected by the policy, and the __control group__ being unaffected by the policy.

    "the policy change. Before the policy change, we observe the control group value $y = A$, and after the policy change, the control group value is $y = E$. In order to estimate the treatment effect using the four pieces of information contained in the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $E$, we make the strong assumption that the two groups experience a __common trend__. In the figure below, the dashed line $BD$ represents what we imagine the treatment group growth would have been in the absence of the policy change. The growth described by the dashed line $BD$ is unobservable, and is obtained by assuming that the growth in the treatment group that is unrelated to the policy change is the same as the growth in the control group. The treatment effect d $CD$ is the difference between the treatment and control values of $y$ in the ‘‘after’’ period, after subtracting $DE$, which is what the difference between the two groups would have been in the absence of the policy. Using the common growth assumption, the difference $DE$ equals the initial difference $AB$. Using the four observable points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $E$ depicted in the figure below, estimation of the treatment effect is based on data averages for the two groups in the two periods."
